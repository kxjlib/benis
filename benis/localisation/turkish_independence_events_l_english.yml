  turkish_war_of_independence_event.1.d:0 "It has been decided through several agreements that Greece shall be awarded the territories of Ionia, and both East and West Thrace, due to their commendable loyalty to the Entente in the Great war. However, currently only one of these territories is administered by Athens, despite the war having ended over a year ago. \nIt has been decided that the Entente will withdraw its garrison from West Thrace (excluding the forces fighting the Ottoman resistance), and full sovereignty will finally be awarded to Athens, effective immediately."
  turkish_war_of_independence_event.1.a:0 "Thanks for your patience, chaps!"
  
  turkish_war_of_independence_event.2.t:0 "The Entente withdraws from Thrace!"
  turkish_war_of_independence_event.2.d:0 "It comes as no surprise that, now that stability in the region has been restored, the Entente has officially ended their occupation of West Thrace and awarded full control of the territory to us."
  turkish_war_of_independence_event.2.a:0 "Excellent!"
